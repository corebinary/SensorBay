SensorBay is an extension of the AI-RAFT project. In plain terms I plan to mount a collection of sensors on top of the raft. SensorBay would collect and analyse the data from the sensors. The early plan right now is to feed that data into the companion computer or directly into ardupilot via mavlink protocol.

Early stage plan to use one forward facing lidar sensor and 3 ultrasonic sensors at the remaining cardinal points. A camera mounted on some kind of stabilizer with servo control for pointing.
